# Array. Array cleaning. Removing duplicates from the array.

Use the `filter()` method to create a new array that contains only unique elements. The `toLowerCase()` method converts each element to lowercase, and the `findIndex()` method is used to find unique elements and add them to the resulting array. Thus, the removeDuplicates(arr) function takes an array of arr and returns a case-insensitive array from which the duplicates were removed.
